            Dearest Father,
        </h1>
        <p>The first thing I should say is thank you. I have had nothing but unending support from you in everything I
            do. Even if the process is difficult and the result is imperfect, you are there as my cheerleader. </p>
        <p> It's a good thing too, because your approval and pride in me is really pretty important to me. It is 
            such a huge part of how I got this far. I sometimes think about some of the goals I had in highschool,
            having stable relationships, being excited about my work and having fulfilling hobbies. Things that, while
            simple, seemed unlikely to me at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I feel like I am getting there, and you were such an integral part of it. You always answer my 
            endless stream of questions and that has helped me maintain a balanced view of the world, and an excitement
            with learning that will be critical in my career. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In such tumultuous times, it is comforting to know some things never change. Your love for me and the hard 
            rock you play while doing the dishes.
        </p>
